# What am I doing these days?

### General
I live in Mandi Dabwali, a small town in Haryana, North India. 

### Reading

#### Non-fiction
I've decided to work on my emotional intelligence/emotional health - whatever you want to call it. For this, I've found Alain de Botton's work to be quite wonderful. I've decided to read mostly his books and his company The School of Life's books in the near future. Once I feel that my emotional health has a strong base, I will move to other genres.

#### Fiction
I am reading Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostovoesky (Penguin Select Classics edition) and thoroughly enjoying it. 

### Health

I am walking/jogging 10 km daily with a long-term goal of improved cardiovascular health. I am also experimenting with my eating habits. I am taking a high-fibre plant-based diet and reducing sugar as much as possible.

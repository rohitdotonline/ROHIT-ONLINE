## Got a minute? Help me find something.

I am looking for the following apps/resources/things:

**1. An AI-essentials educational resource for non-tech people**

I am looking for a website with some key educational pages with content like the best prompting methods, use cases of AI for the average user, what model is best for what purpose, etc. Such content should be updated regularly. And a bi-weekly or monthly newsletter on the big updates in the AI sector that are relevant for non-tech folks.

**2. BearBlog, but for personal websites**

I am using BearBlog for this website. If you don't know what BearBlog is, it's a super minimalist platform for creating blogs. 

But, BearBlog focuses on publishing blog posts and archiving them at yourwebsite.com/blog according to the published dates. I want something that focuses on creating pages and archiving them at locations of my choice according to designated tags/categories, not according to the published date. I want to grow a personal website, not a blog.

#### If you know of any of these services, please forward me the link at hello (@) rohit.online

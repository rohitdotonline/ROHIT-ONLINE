I failed at journaling 5-6 times before it finally stuck. Here are a few things that help me journal consistently:

- I journal the [Derek Sivers way](https://sive.rs/dj) which means writing two types of journals. First, a daily journal for documenting and understanding daily life. Second, 'thoughts on' journals where I've made files on important topics in my life like friendship, love, technology, money, city, etc. and I update my thoughts on the topics regularly. I write in simple text files. This method keeps journaling minimal and effective.

- I want to journal daily but I understand that it's okay to miss them. One day missed is OK, and ten days missed is OK. I don't self-flagellate if I miss. I simply start again. My monkey brain connects journaling with catharsis, not guilt and suffering.

- I don't write yesterday's journal if I've missed it, as that doubles the cognitive load. First, I write today's journal. Then, if I feel like it, I write yesterday's journal.Â 

- I write the journals in the evening when everything that is supposed to happen has happened. But, I create DDMMYYYY.txt file earlier in the day whenever I get time. This makes it easier to add the content later. (I keep the text editing app open in the background since no one touches my laptop.) In the evening, all I have to do is start typing.

- Every day, I start the journal entry with 'Today I woke up at XX AM.' Writing the first sentence answers the BIG question of what should I start with. The first sentence is done, then I write the second sentence.

- I understand it's better to journal even a few days a month than to quit journaling because of guilt of inconsistency. 

On average, I've been journaling five days a week for the past few months. To make the habit even stickier, I will try to implement some of Atomic Habit's learning and update what works for me here.

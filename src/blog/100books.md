I've been reading books for about a decade now (school and college books are not counted). But it occurred to me only last year that the end goal is not to increase my reading count; I can re-read the books I loved reading the first time.

Re-reading works because you add more experiences to your concious as you age. The second time you read, you get more nuance. The third time you re-read, the nuance increases even more, and so on. And some classic books are meant to be imbibed, not just read, which can happen only if you re-read them many times.

To further realize this idea, I decided to enlist 100 books I want to re-read all my life.

## The List
I've added only those books that I read after 17 Feb, 2025. The list is fluid. (It will take years to fill the list. Keep revisiting this page if you need book suggestions.)

Firstly, some thoughts on quotes.

1) I don't like embedding quotes in my writing or speech because they break the flow. Your reader or listener starts to think about the author of the quote instead of its content. So, I don’t use quotes unless I want to introduce my reader to the quote author. Mostly, I just paraphrase. 

2) Quotes are not truths with a capital T. They are just frameworks to look at things. Take this quote for example: 

> “All of our miseries are nothing but attachment.” — Osho

This quote gives an interesting perspective. Nothing more than that; just a perspective. Interestingly, there can be many perspectives. Here's the anti-quote of Osho's quote:

> “The sweetness of life lies in connections and attachments." — Rohit

3) The shorter the sentence, the harder it hits. And quotes hit the hardest because they describe great perspectives in short sentences. 



Now, here are some quotes I want to keep revisiting. The list might change as I change my perspective toward things:

6. Look for single decisions that remove hundreds or thousands of other decisions. — Tim Ferris

7. You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. — Benjamin Graham

8. No writing creates no writing. Some writing creates more writing. — Roy Peter Clark

9. Take a simple idea and take it seriously. — Charlie Munger

10. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. — Zen saying (probably)

11. You don't have to dance alone; you can dance with your shadow. — My friend Ishan Jindal (he said this while dancing with his shadow, 12:35 AM, 20 March 2024)

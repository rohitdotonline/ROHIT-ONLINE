Book reviews, product reviews, and comment sections of songs are filled with the phrase “this xyz thing changed my life.” But I doubt that a trolley bag or a romantic novel featuring wolverines can change anyone’s life.  

The less loaded words you use, the more weight your words carry. So, I refrain from using terms like ‘life-changing’ or ‘paradigm-shift.’

However, there are rare occasions when something new enters my life and it actually changes everything. Then I feel the urge to shout out to the world, “this xyz thing changed my life; please try it.”

Here is a list of a few things that truly changed my life (there is no other way to describe). I will add to this list as I find more.

1. ### Minimizing sugar intake

I remember many occasions when I ate 0.25 to 0.5 kg of sweets in a day. One day, I heard how harmful sugar is from two of my heroes. A few days later, I visited a close friend who had minimized his sugar intake and was looking handsomer. I followed.

Now I feel better, more energetic, and agile. I lost some extra fat and look younger.

2. ### Sleeping during the night, working during the day

I used to be a night owl for more than a decade. But for some reason, in late 2023, I had to sleep early for about a month. And suddenly, I realized that I was feeling better and better every day. Since then I’ve changed my sleeping habits.

Compared to my night owl days, I now feel more energetic and agile. There was this mental fog I used to feel throughout the day and night. Now, the fog is gone, my head feels lighter, and I can think with more clarity.
 
3. ### Journaling

Is there a more cliched thing than journaling? 

Well, what I discovered is that journaling is underhyped, not overhyped. It's the most effective way to get mental peace and improve emotional intelligence. 

At first, I thought I was overhyping the benefits of journaling in my brain because I had heard about it from multiple heroes of mine. But after about 1.5 months of journaling, two of my friends said that something had changed in me. Then I knew that it really worked.

I've become calmer and more content. Also, I can see a world that doesn't revolve around Rohit.

I do daily journaling and topic journaling the [Derek Sivers way](tab:https://sive.rs/dj).

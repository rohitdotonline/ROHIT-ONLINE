In this post, I want to share my experience setting up this personal website using Eleventy (11ty).

## Why I Chose 11ty

After exploring various static site generators, I settled on 11ty for a few reasons:

1. **Simplicity** - It has a straightforward setup with minimal complexity
2. **Flexibility** - Works with multiple template languages
3. **Performance** - Generates fast, lightweight static sites
4. **No frontend framework required** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS is all you need

## The Setup Process

Setting up an 11ty site was surprisingly easy. Here's a brief overview of the steps I took:

1. Installed 11ty via npm
2. Created basic folder structure
3. Set up templates and layouts
4. Added styling with simple CSS
5. Created some initial content

## What I've Learned

The biggest lesson I've learned is that sometimes simpler is better. With 11ty, I can focus on writing content rather than fighting with complex build processes or overengineered solutions.

I'm looking forward to expanding this site with more features while keeping it fast and minimal.

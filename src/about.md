# Rohit who?

A 29-year-old guy, born and raised in Mandi Dabwali, a small town in North India. I earn my share of food by writing for people. Here are some things that define who I am:


## I Read
I read almost anything and everything. I like reading books and blogs, comments and product guides, 50-year-old sales pages, and billboards. 

I find the different shapes of letters beautiful and amaze at how strings of words can make complex meanings.

## I Walk
Initially, I never gave it enough thought. Should it even be counted as something? But lately, I've realized that I absolutely love walking. And it is *something* to talk about.

Walking alone or with friends, either works for me. Sometimes I talk on the phone while walking, other times I simply watch the dogs playing around. Life feels better when I walk a few kilometers every day.

## I Write
I write both personal and professional pieces. What you are reading right now is a personal one.

My goal with this blog is to explore my interests publicly. Though the write-ups are personal, I intend to keep you — the reader — in mind.

## I Love
I love conversing with friends, playing nine-ball pool, going down internet rabbit holes, sitting alone for hours, walking while listening to podcasts, and drinking tea.

And I love to love.

## I Work
I wrote news for media startups for a few years. Now I write for small to mid-sized businesses. And I am planning to move to full-time creative writing. 

## I Live
I've spent all my life either in my hometown or in Delhi. However, I am an internet native at heart. I found the first love of my life on the internet. I’ve found many good friends on the Internet. And I've found you (we might become friends someday, who knows) on the internet.

## I Talk
